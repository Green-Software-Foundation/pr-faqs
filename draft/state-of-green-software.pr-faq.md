# THE GSF RELEASES STATE OF GREEN SOFTWARE REPORT TO SURFACE SUSTAINABILITY INSIGHTS TO THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY.

In response to groundswell interest in Green Software, in January 2023, the Green Software Foundation released the first in an annual series of State of Green Software reports.

The report summarises information gathered from targeted research, expert interviews, and the most significant green software survey ever conducted. 10s of thousands of professionals, including software practitioners, industry executives, and academics, answered detailed questions about sustainability and green software. As a result, for the first time, the software industry has a trusted resource with the latest peer-reviewed research, global trends, key actors, open-source tooling, and user research regarding green software.

An ecosystem around green software is larger than any one organization, and within it lies shared goals that multiple organizations hold and initiatives that complement each other. 

The State of Green Software report answers the following questions:

* What are the current state and future trends related to green software?
* What is the state of the art regarding green software research, including the correct most up-to-date stats we should all be quoting?
* What is the user experience regarding green software from the perspective of software practitioners and executive leadership?
* Who are the key actors in the green software ecosystem, the industry bodies, advocacy groups, regulatory bodies, and environmental coalitions?
* What high-impact policy events and upcoming regulation is on the horizon that impacts green software?
* What green software open-source tooling is currently available, and where are the gaps?

The State of Green Software report will highlight gaps in the green software ecosystem and drive investment toward filling those gaps. It will help people understand what kind of motivations will result in the best outcomes. It will better prepare organizations for upcoming regulations and policies. It will reduce duplication of effort by shining a light on the activity’s key actors are already engaged in

"To really make an impact on emissions reduction in the tech sector, we need coordinated action on policy strategies that are actionable, scalable, and in line with climate science." - Co-Chair GSF Policy Working Group, Elise Zelechowski.

“The State of Green Software Report is something I wished I had four years ago when I first started to explore this space. If you want to convince your leadership to invest in your green software project, send them your proposal and attach this report as the proof point.” – Asim Hussain, Executive Director @ Green Software Foundation.
