# The Green Software Foundation publishes its Theory Of Change to enable members understand how the Foundation will meet its mission

In June 2022, the Green Software Foundation published its [Theory Of Change](https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/toc-background/toc-benefits/). A comprehensive description and illustration of how the Foundation will achieve its mission.

The first eight members decided on the GSF’s initial strategy. However, the Foundation has since grown to 29 members, so the strategy needed to evolve and include more voices.

As the GSF matured, the number and complexity of our projects have increased, making it harder to explain how our projects will help us achieve our mission. 

With limited resources and time, the GSF needed a framework for deciding which projects to prioritize and where to focus resources.

A Theory Of Change describes why a particular way of working will be effective, showing how change happens in the short, medium, and long term to achieve the intended impact. It can be represented in a visual diagram, a narrative, or both.

The GSF gathered key stakeholders from our Steering Committee, our Working Group and Project chair to collaborate over six hour-long workshop sessions to generate its Theory Of Change. 

“Our mission and vision tell us the place we want to reach, our Theory Of Change tells us how we will get there.” - Asim Hussain, Green Software Foundation.

“There are many non-profits, or even for-profits, at the intersection of sustainability and technology. The Theory Of Change illustration from the GSF helped me understand where the GSF fits into that landscape” - Sample Person, Member Organization.

# FAQ

### Why are we doing this?

The initial strategy of the Foundation was defined by the core eight members soon after launch, we have now grown to 28. This is an important opportunity to include more voices in the strategy setting.

### We joined the Foundation because of its existing focus, will this exercise change its focus area?

Our focus is eliminating emissions due to software. The intention of this exercise is not to change the purpose of the Foundation but to help clarify and get a shared understanding about how the Foundation will achieve this. Who is our target audience? What outcomes do we want? What intermediate steps are signals that we are on the right track?

### Can you remind me of the mission and vision of the Foundation?

Mission: Build a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling and best practices for creating and building green software.

Vision: Change the culture of building software across the tech industry, so sustainability becomes a core priority to software teams, just as important as performance, security, cost and accessibility.

### Is this going to change any of the by-laws of the Foundation?

No, this exercise will not change how we function, any of our by-laws or our consensus based model. This is purely a task force which will help create a theory of change document.

### Who needs to be included in the process?

Representatives from the Steering Committee as well as chairs of the Working Groups and Projects.

### How many people can take part?

We may potentially have over 20 people taking part in the process, this can be challenging. Each steering committee can nominate only one person to take part, ideally that person is also a chair of a working group or project since every chair of a working group or project will also be included.

### How much time will you need from a participant?

The exercise will run over six 1-hour-long workshop sessions coordinated over zoom. So 6 hours in total over a number of weeks.

We are keen to complete the process by July 2022 as this will help us prioritize the projects and investments we need to make for the rest of the year.

### Will we need to join meetings or can we work asynchronously?

The best way to facilitate this is to arrange live zoom meetings. We understand that for some the times of the meeting will be challenging and we will aim to stagger the sessions.


### What are the deliverables we will have from this exercise?

A one pager or diagram which describes the Foundations Theory Of Change. This is the Theory Of Change deliverable for another non-profit climateaction.tech [https://www.figma.com/file/wRsxc6vLgUzRyp7Sz63NQZ/Theory-of-change?node-id=58%3A0](https://www.figma.com/file/wRsxc6vLgUzRyp7Sz63NQZ/Theory-of-change?node-id=58%3A0)

### What questions will the theory of change help us answer?

This is a broad exercise that will help us define the impact we want to have on the world, the long term outcomes we want to achieve and an agreement among stakeholders about what defines success and what it takes to get there.
