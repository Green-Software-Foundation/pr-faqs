# Green Software Foundation launched the Carbon Hack 2022, moving the needle on carbon awareness in software via a prized competitive event for developers

 

_Long-needed software carbon awareness functionalities are bound to positively impact climate change._

_ _

At COP27 in November 2022, GSF announced the winners of the Carbon Hack, a 3 week competition for developers to build the best carbon aware application with a total 50K USD prize fund.

Some electricity is generated through dirtier high carbon sources like coal and gas, some is generated from cleaner low carbon sources like solar, wind or nuclear. Carbon aware software does less when the electricity is dirty and does more when the electricity is clean, for instance a carbon aware battery might charge only at the times of the day when the electricity is clean.

There are no toolkits to simplify the process of adding carbon awareness to applications, everything needs to be built from scratch.

That’s why the Green Software Foundation is creating the Carbon Aware SDK, an open source toolkit for building carbon aware applications. A collaborative effort from multiple corporate and non-profit partners, the Carbon Aware SDK will reduce the barriers for software practitioners in creating carbon aware applications. 

Few developers know about carbon awareness, how to implement it in their applications or even that it’s an option to reduce carbon emissions.

Carbon Hack 22 will get thousands of talented developers worldwide engaged in a 3 week competition to build the best carbon aware application using the Carbon Aware SDK. Winners will be announced at COP27 with a prize fund of 100K USD. 

“Carbon Awareness is one of the hottest topics in the Green Software Space and now with the Carbon Aware SDK it’s easier than ever to build a carbon aware application” said Asim Hussain, chairperson GSF.

“Carbon awareness is an area where we are making significant investments, we see it as an important strategy in reducing the emissions from our technology - we’re excited to have sponsored the most innovative carbon aware solution track and looking forward to the solutions people will develop” said John Doe at ACME Corp.

# FAQ


## I don’t know much about Carbon Awareness. How do I find out more?

Carbon Awareness is a new area of computing, you can find more information about it at [https://principles.green/](https://principles.green/) and specifically [https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/](https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/) and https://principles.green/principles/demand-shaping/

## What is the Carbon Aware SDK, where can I find it?

The Carbon Aware Core SDK is a project to build a common core, that is flexible, agnostic, and open, allowing software and systems to build around carbon aware capabilities, and provide the information so those systems themselves become carbon aware.

The Carbon Aware Core API will look to standardise and simplify carbon awareness for developers through a unified API, command line interface, and modular carbon-aware-logic plugin architecture.

The home of the SDK is here: https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk

## Do you have any tutorials or examples of how to build a carbon aware application using the Carbon Aware SDK?

Tutorial will be available by the time the SDK is released


## I’m having trouble with the SDK during the hackathon. Can someone help me?

There will be regular office hours during the hackathon where experts in carbon awareness and the SDK will make themselves available to answer questions in addition the hackathon website will list mentors who are willing to be directly contacted and asked questions about green software.

                                                                                                                                                                  


## I want to sponsor a prize, what do I do?

Organizations who would like to sponsor a prize category are free to email doha@greensoftware.foundation and discuss options. 

You can either sponsor an existing prize track and add prizes to it, so e.g. ACME Corp sponsored the Most Innovative prize.

Or you can sponsor a new prize track, e.g. ACME Corp sponsors the ACME Prize, the best carbon aware solution that uses the ACME platform.


## Can you win in multiple categories?

No, you can only win one prize.


## How will solutions be judged?

At the end of the hackathon we’ll ask you to create a 1 min video demonstrating your solutions. The judges will be evaluating it on several criteria.

There may be other judging criteria for sponsored prize tracks.


## I have an idea for a solution but I don’t know how to build it?

The hackathon website will have a place where you can post ideas for a solution and gather interest from a team.

Mentors might help you formulate it better and then if it’s interesting other people might comment and form teams around implementing it.


## I don’t have an idea for a solution but I just want to get involved?

The hackathon website has a matchmaking service where it will connect you with teams looking for help.


## Will the contest be for a specific programming language?

Any programming language is accepted in the solution, the carbon aware SDK is available in 40 different programming languages. 

 


## Are there any fees?

There are no fees associated with participating in the contest.


## Where can I find more information, and how can I sign up?

More information, including the signup form, can be found at https://carbonhack22.greensoftware.foundation
