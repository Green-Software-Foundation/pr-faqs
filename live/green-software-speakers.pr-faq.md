# Green Software Foundation launches Speakers Bureau platform facilitating the search and booking of world-class speakers in the green software space

_Once hard to find green software speakers are now accessible on an easy-to-navigate platform._

Ahead of COP27 in November 2022, GSF launched its <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Speakers Bureau</span>, a comprehensive catalogue of speakers in the area of green software. 

Since the first GSF Global Summit in June 2022, the demand for expert presenters has continuously increased. GSF believes it is no longer realistic to ignore climate change within software development. No major IT conference will likely take place without at least one green software speaker in the future. The Speakers Bureau was launched as a subsection of the GSF website.

Speakers on the topic of green software are exceedingly hard to find, let alone to figure out their availability if they are even responsive via traditional methods of contact. 

There is a demand for speakers in different geographic areas and for different languages, and speakers who can confidently inform on the GSF and its projects.

The GSF Speakers Bureau is the one-stop shop for any and all speakers on the topic of green software. It is a comprehensive database featuring speakers from all continents, various regions and countries, able to present in local languages, wherever needed. 

Contacting individual or multiple speakers is made easy and secure through the platform. Conveniently search by areas of expertise, by certifications, geography, languages, and more to find the right speaker for your event.

The Speakers Bureau is also intended as support for GSF members in their speaking engagements. Not only is it capable of promoting speakers, but the platform will be able to cross the bridge to speaker resources and materials, speaker training, mentoring and education, to truly foster a best-in-class environment. These features are planned for the version 2.0 release in April 2023 ahead of Earth Day.

“Software conferences no longer have to scramble in search of green software speakers. Every single person on the planet who is a presenter in this field already has a profile on the GSF Speakers Bureau”, says Anne Currie, co-chair, GSF community working group.

“We were extremely pleased with how easy it was for us to find and secure the speakers for our _International Green Software Conference._ There is no way we could have held such a flawless event without the help of the GSF Speakers Bureau.” Jenny, event manager, IGSC.
